My Project is about a to do list app; SCRIBBLES TO DO LIST APP.
SCRIBBLES-ASS1.docx contains a one pager with a description of the project goals and features.It also contains UML diagram symbols.
SCRIBBLES-ASS2.docx contains the methodology used to design the app, context diagram(contextual model), interaction diagram(use case diagram), structural model and behavioural model(activity diagram).
FIGMA DESIGN file contains the design of the to do list app.
index.html, style.css and script.js contain the codes I used to build the app.
The remaining files were used in my attempt to build the file but are now unnecessary.
